            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Sibulelo Nkambule, though I often go by the nickname Thabang. My journey began in the picturesque landscapes of KwaZulu Natal, specifically in the vibrant village of Embabane. I hail from a close-knit family of six, which includes three siblings, my loving grandmother, and a supportive uncle.

                My educational path began at Embabane Primary School, where I took my first steps into the world of learning. As I advanced in my studies, I transitioned to Mziwethu High School for my high school years. It was during this time that a significant change took place in my life. Just before completing my 11th grade and matriculation, I relocated to the bustling township of Mayibuye in Gauteng's Tembisa.

                My academic journey took a fascinating turn when I pursued a degree in Chemical Engineering at Tshwane University of Technology. This year marks the culmination of my dedicated efforts in this field. What sets me apart is my unwavering commitment to learning and growing.
